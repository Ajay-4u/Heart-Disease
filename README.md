# Heart-Disease
A project that requires working with a dataset from the medical industry.

Preparing this data for modeling requires that outliers are identified and removed, duplicate data are identified, and missing values are treated. 
The trends and relationships between different features of the dataset would also be displayed (using univariate and bivariate techniques) to gain a better understanding of the available data and derive useful insights from it.

While the goal of this project is to train a model that can predict whether a person is likely to suffer from heart disease or not (whether the probability is above or below 50%); the task here is to observe and analyze the distribution of the data, search for outliers and missing values, and assess the relationships between features.
